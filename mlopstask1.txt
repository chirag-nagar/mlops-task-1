First job when some developer push to dev branch of git then Jenkins will fetch from dev branch and deploy on dev-docker environment(testing env) created by docker container.

Second job also doing the same thing but with production env. Manually the QA team will check (test) for the website running fine in dev-docker environment then

Third job Jenkins will merge the dev branch to master branch and trigger second job.
